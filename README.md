## Inspiration
As Face-Detection and Face-Recognition are a major part of security-based systems. Software with features like facial recognition is ncessary and mostly widely used by people so that they are secure.

## About the project

<p align="center">

      
### Overview
It detects faces from an image from a given data-set of images. It also has an accurate analysis of recognizing image.

HTML CSS JavaScript with Face API<br/>


## How I built it

First we came up with a problem statement and started to design and prototype.

Then we followed with building a basic prototype of all the features that can be included. 

Then went with designing and developing UI using HTML & CSS (with help of few resources mentioned in the last section). 


## Challenges I ran into

Linking the API and using the resources as I was not familiar with it.


## What's next for Face_Recognition

Due to the time constraint of the hackathon, many things were accomplished only till half way. These include :

- Unique CSS Design
- More functionalities that can be used from the APi like detection of various expression on a real time camera.
